# Contributing to csscss

First of all: thanks!

The main way to contribute to csscss is to write some code! Here's how:

1. Fork csscss
2. Create a topic branch - `git checkout -b my_branch`
3. Push to your branch - `git push origin my_branch`
4. Create a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) from your
   branch
5. That's it!

If you're not doing some sort of refactoring, a CHANGELOG entry is appropriate.
Please include them in pull requests adding features or fixing bugs.

## Tests

csscss uses minitest for testing.

A simple `bundle exec rake` will run all the tests. Make sure they pass when
you submit a pull request.

Please include tests with your pull request.

## Bugs & Feature Requests

You can file bugs on the [issues
tracker](https://github.com/zmoazeni/csscss/issues), and tag them with 'bug'. Feel free to discuss features there, too.

### Good report structure

Please include the following four things in your report:

1. What you did.
2. What you expected to happen.
3. What happened instead.

The more information the better.
